### How it works? ###

Simply Create -> Game Event -> And then name it anything, then use GameEvent in a script to act as the Observer 
and GameEventListener as the Listener to events as a serperate script on the gameobject.

This is inspector based, bad if params are involved, simply instead do action event scripts as an alternative.
