# Scriptable Object Events

Is a scope in which listeners subs to observers and react accordingly when functionality is triggered from inspector level.

Simply Create -> Game Event -> And then name it anything, then use GameEvent in a script to act as the Observer 
and GameEventListener as the Listener to events as a serperate script on the gameobject.

In concept very powerful tool, but in practice it struggles with parameters inputs and more, in this case a much better option that is not a inspector based is required,
see "Unity Event Actions" which is utilized in Objectives System.
