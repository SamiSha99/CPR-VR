# Cardiopulmonary Resuscitation and Automated Electrical Debfibrillator

The procedure has already been defined in a document that was forwarded to me at the beginning of the semester explaining the step by step.
This document try to summarize what needs to be done, using symbols to imply what is required for each.

👀[*_*] implies that its visual and requires no coding and subsequently finishes itself.
📜[/] implies that it requires coding

        *	📜[/] Deliver compressions at a rate of 100 to 120/min | 📝[...] **Calculate per second to get average approximation of 30 presses** 
        *	❓[?] Allow complete chest recoil after each compression without leaning on the chest between compressions. | 📝[...] **What does this mean? (sorry)** 
        *	📜[/] Minimize interruptions in chest compressions (trying to limit any interruptions in chest compressions to less than 10 seconds).
7. 📜[/] Coming AED case
