# CPR-VR
A Virtual Reality Prototype meant to simulate a CPR situation in which you learn how to provide the correct procedure in a life crisis.

## About

I've worked on this as part of my internship, the project was really good that I was hired as a VR developer in Arab American University, this project provides support for both controller and hand tracking and uses game development design to gamify the procedure while staying educational, the project has a 4-minutes video (in Arabic only) teaching what needs to be done in CPR followed by practicing in a real scenario with guidance and finally examination which tests what students learned.

Has bHaptic support for TactGlove DK1 to allow for immersive experience with hand tracking.

## Localization

Arabic is complete but English is still missing in some areas and uses Text to Speech. Testers were all Arabs from the West Bank and Arabs within (aka Arabs of Israel) so English wasn't a high priority.
